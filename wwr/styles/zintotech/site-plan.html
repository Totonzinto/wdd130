        [Sharing valuable information]
        <p>We live in a modern age where informations are important, however restricting information will be unhealthy, the internet is a place where researchers go to make findings.it is important to value informations made available in the internet as well as appreciating the rights of people who share this informations thereby bringing you out of the dark. In today's world information is a powerful tool that keeps people, companies, business personnels updated, even though some people feel that certain information should be kept private or hidden from the internet, I strongly believe that as much information should be shared,because it also help to promote honesty and trust between the clients and the company or business owner. when informations are shared other people tend to build on them to improve their work which tend to help them progress,How we treat information matters a lot, through research I have come to find out that when we treat or handle information with a good approach we tend to stay away from trouble or things that might endanger our lives. As individuals who uses air conditions it is important to pay attention to any information concerning them, sometimes it is hard for some individuals to service or maintain their air condition, forgetting that once the air condition gets dirty it is difficult to function well, the system will start to malfunction.informations are vital to what ever we do. And that is the reason why I’m creating this website which is going to be a place where needs will be met, information will be shared,ideas will be given on specific things. However there is going to be a need between sharing this information and protecting them,some types of information will be shared freely. </p>

      <h3>[Air condition and its process of installation]</h3>
      <p>
        [Often times we want comfort in our homes and sometimes we get busy by the responsibilities of life, and forgetting the little things that matter. Air conditioning is the the process or the mechanical means of removing heat from a particular space to a desired temperature without undue discomfort.It is also the type of refrigeration in which moist air temperature is controlled for human comfort,the process includes heat removal from or added to a particular space thereby making it more cooler or warmer with consequent control of the moisture content. Installation of air condition can be done differently by different technicians. But to determine the size of the air condition that you want in a particular space you need to first, you need the floor measurement of the particular space, determine the amount of people that will stay there, then determine how many watts the light bulbs are going to have, then also add other appliances that are going to be there like television etc. When you calculate all of these measurement you can then determine the size of air condition you need to purchase.
        Installation process
        1.First step to take is to access the space and determine the position.
        2. Between the ceiling and the hanging plate take a measurement of about 150mm.
        3.Use a plum.
        4.  Place the plate carefully and insert tornado nails to ensure it is 
            firm.
        5.Drill a hole beside the plate using installation guideline booklet.
        6..Hang the indoor unit on the plate and ensure refrigerant pipes, water hose, and cable pass through the hole.
        7. With additional refrigerant pipes(installation kits) connect to the outdoor unit.
        8.Then make sure the pipes goes to the right sides and use adjustable spanner to tighten the nuts.]

      <h3>[Consistency/Benefits of the website]</h3>
      <p>
        [ Consistency is key to success, it is the ability to never give up or in other words stay on track in pursuit of your dream no matter how hard or incontinent they might be, it is just like persevering and having your end goal in mind. This requires efforts, self-discipline and focus. It also requires patience and enduring to get to where you want to be. Martin Luther said “if you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run, then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.” and that is what consistency is all about having the ability to keep moving no matter how tough the situation might be. And one of the good thing about this website is going to be consistency in sharing information, over the past years informations were shared through mail, radio, and sometimes it takes days to get to know what is going on or a particular  thing. However this is also going to be a place for providing feedback channels for people who visits the website and also providing satisfaction for them, as well as the visitors can then give their feedback concerning the website. And consistency is our goal, helping each of our visitors and audience get whatever information they need.]
