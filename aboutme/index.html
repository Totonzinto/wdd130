    <p>Hi everyone let me introduce myself i'm from Nigeria, from Abia state, but i stay in Lagos which is a busy area.</p>
    <p>Well i have been a member of the church for sixteen years, and i have a very large family, i and my family loves the gospel of jesus christ so much, it has molded us to be better friends to everyone around us, i love the quote by president Gordon B Hinckley, which says don't be discouraged things will work out.</p>
    <p>I love to do a lot of things but mostly i love listening to music and playing video games.</p>
