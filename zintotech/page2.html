            <h2>Air conditioning</h2>
            <p>Often times we want comfort in our homes and sometimes we get busy by the responsibilities of life, and forgetting the little things that matter. Air conditioning is the the process or the mechanical means of removing heat from a particular space to a desired temperature without undue discomfort.It is also the type of refrigeration in which moist air temperature is controlled for human comfort,the process includes heat removal from or added to a particular space thereby making it more cooler or warmer with consequent control of the moisture content. Installation of air condition can be done differently by different technicians. But to determine the size of the air condition that you want in a particular space you need to first, you need the floor measurement of the particular space, determine the amount of people that will stay there, then determine how many watts the light bulbs are going to have, then also add other appliances that are going to be there like television etc. When you calculate all of these measurement you can then determine the size of air condition you need to purchase.
