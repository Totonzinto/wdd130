            <p>Consistency is key to success, it is the ability to never give up or in other words stay on track in pursuit of your dream no matter how hard or incontinent they might be, it is just like persevering and having your end goal in mind. This requires efforts, self-discipline and focus. It also requires patience and enduring to get to where you want to be. Martin Luther said “if you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run, then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.” and that is what consistency is all about having the ability to keep moving no matter how tough the situation might be. And one of the good thing about this website is going to be consistency in sharing information, over the past years informations were shared through mail, radio, and sometimes it takes days to get to know what is going on or a particular thing. However this is also going to be a place for providing feedback channels for people who visits the website and also providing satisfaction for them, as well as the visitors can then give their feedback concerning the website. And consistency is our goal, helping each of our visitors and audience get whatever information they need.</p>
